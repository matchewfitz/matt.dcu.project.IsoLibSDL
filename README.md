IsoLibSDL
=========

IsoLibSDL (Final Year Project) is an Isometric games library







.....(albeit more of a proof of concept) 


I developed for my final year project. I've always been meaning to continue development, just for fun. Now I'm making a start. The project was awarded a prize in IBM's open source competition for university computer science FYPs. 

Up til now, it was only Open Source via my defunct personal web page, now it's here! Enjoy!




Feel free to ask me for any info regarding the project.
