IsoLibSDL


IsoLibSDL (Final Year Project) is an Isometric games library

.....(albeit more of a proof of concept)

I developed for my final year project. I've always been meaning to continue development, just for fun. Now I'm making a start. The project was awarded a prize in IBM's open source competition for university computer science FYPs.

Up til now, it was only Open Source via my defunct personal web page, now it's here! Enjoy!

Feel free to ask me for any info regarding the project.

FAQs (well by frequently, I mean, well.. you get the idea)

1) This code is really crummy,  I mean REALLY crummy!

That's not really a question, but to address your concerns, yes, it is pretty crummy. It's not even the version I submitted to be graded in College. This one is from a little earlier in the development and, not very well designed... yeah.

2) Why would you release this crummy software?

Well, I always wanted to finish this thing, I mean, really make a fully fledged engine out of it. Hosting it on GitHub was the first step of getting back into developing it.

3) This really is crummy software and you appear to be very stupid, can I call you Crummy Dummy?

That's not very polite, please stop insulting me.

4) When will this project be next updated?

Well, hopefully it'll be very soon. I need to test and rebuild parts of the code I omitted and hopefully make the system altogether more efficient, let's say within a few weeks.

5) Am I adopted?

Well I don't rightly know, but considering how rude you've been throughout this FAQ, I wouldn't be surprised if you were dumped on a doorstep for being so rude you big rudie rude person.


I'm sorry, that was out of line. I'm sure your parents (the ones you know of anyway) love you within the minimum and maximum love parameters as defined by international mandate.

6) Will you be my friend?

Ummm, oh look at that, some gravel. How INTERESTING.
